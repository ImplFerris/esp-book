# Intro

In this book, we use the ESP32 DevKit V1 and program it in Rust to explore various exciting projects. 


## Prerequisites
If you haven't already read the ["The Rust on ESP Book"](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/introduction.html), I highly recommend doing so first. While this book will cover some aspects of setting up the development environment and basic concepts, it will not go into as much detail to avoid unnecessary repetition, as these topics are already thoroughly explained in the official book.

## Meet the Hardware
We will be using one of the development board "ESP32 DevKit V1", which comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, along with an integrated RF module
