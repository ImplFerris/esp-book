# Intro

This book is an informal collection of what I explore, tinker with, and learn along the way. The content isn't meant to be professional; Just raw documentation of my journey.

## Prerequisites
If you haven't already read the ["The Rust on ESP Book"](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/introduction.html), I highly recommend doing so first. While this book will cover some aspects of setting up the development environment and basic concepts, it will not go into as much detail to avoid unnecessary repetition, as these topics are already thoroughly explained in the official book.
